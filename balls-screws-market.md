<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balls Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Circulation Ball Screw</li><li>External Circulation Ball Screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ball screw market primarily features two types: internal circulation and external circulation ball screws. Internal circulation ball screws have ball bearings that circulate within the screw shaft, providing compact designs and high precision. They are ideal for applications requiring limited space. Conversely, external circulation ball screws allow balls to travel outside the nut, offering better load capacities and improved heat dissipation. This design is more suitable for heavy-duty applications where strength and efficiency are critical.</p></p>
