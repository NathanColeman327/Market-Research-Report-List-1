<p><strong>The Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recovery Type Plant</li><li>Non Recovery Type Plant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) systems are utilized in both recovery and non-recovery type coke plants to enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact. In recovery type plants, CDQ captures waste heat from hot coke, converting it into steam or power for reuse, thereby increasing overall plant efficiency. In non-recovery type plants, CDQ focuses on cooling produced coke while reducing emissions, although it doesn't recycle heat. Both applications improve operational sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in coke production.</p></p>
