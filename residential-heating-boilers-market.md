<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential heating boilers market consists of two main types: non-condensing and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate at lower efficiency, expelling a significant amount of heat through flue gases, which can lead to energy loss. In contrast, condensing boilers achieve higher efficiency by extracting heat from the exhaust gases and using it to pre-heat incoming water. This results in lower energy consumption and reduced emissions, making condensing boilers more environmentally friendly and cost-effective in the long run.</p></p>
